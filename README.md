# React Timer

:timer*clock: \_Building a timer using create-react-app.*

The purpose of this project is to practice our React hooks skills such as `useState` `useRef` and `Custom Hook`

Everyone know what a timer is eventhough not all timers look the same. Today, we are making a timer that look like this , (_or better!_)

[Check out this demo to see it in action !](https://cs-react-timer.netlify.app/)

## User Story

- User click start button to start the timer
- User can not click start button while timer is running
- User click stop button to see timer stop
- User can click start to re-start the timer after stop
- User can click reset button at anytime to reset the timer
- :rocket: User see a different timer than the one from this example. _Meaning you should change the UI display_
- :rocket::rocket::rocket: User can "split" the timer, creating multiple records of time per "split-button clicked"
